# Introduction

Sand is an object-oriented language that can be compiled to semi-readable Java.

It is not uncommon for introductory computer science courses to focus exclusively on Java.

If you are taking one of these courses, but find Java to be a pain to write, consider learning Sand.

This book assumes you are already familiar with Java.
