# Introduction

Sand is an object-oriented language that can be compiled to mostly readable Java.

Why would anybody want to do this?

It is not uncommon for introductory computer science courses to make heavy use of Java.
For example, the [College Board's AP Computer Science A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science_A) exclusively uses Java.

If you are taking one of these courses, but find Java to be a pain to write, consider learning Sand.

This book assumes you are already familiar with Java.

## How to read this book

If you are already comfortable with several object-oriented programming languages, there's a good chance Sand's syntax will look familiar.
If you want to dive right in and are looking for a quick TL;DR, check out the [Sand in a nutshell chapter](./nutshell/intro.md).

For a more thorough introduction, you can read all the sections of the [language features chapter](./feature_list/data/intro.md).

**WARNING: as of now, the language features chapter is a work in progress and far from complete.**
