# Operators

## Expressions

Sand has most of the operator expressions you're familiar with from Java:

- `+` (concatentation)
- `*`, `/`, `%`
- `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction)
- `-` (negative)
- `!`
- `&&`, `||`
- `==`, `!=`, `<` `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- `[]` (sequence element access)

Sand also has the following operator expressions:

- `**` - exponentiation
- `~=` - `.equals()` equality
- `~` - a prefix operator that converts an array to a resizable list

## Statements
