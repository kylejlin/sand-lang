# Operators

## Expressions

Sand has most of the operator expressions you're familiar with from Java:

- `+` (concatentation)

- `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction)
- `-` (negative)
- `!`
- `&&`, `||`
- `==`, `!=`, `<` `>`, `<=`, `>=`

Sand also has the following operator expressions:

- `**` - exponentiation
- `~=` - `.equals()` equality
- `~` - array-to-resizable-list conversion (see [Lists](./lists.md))

## Statements

### Assignments

Sand supports

- `=`
- `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `**=`

Sand does not support post- or pre- increment or decrement (`++` and `--`).
