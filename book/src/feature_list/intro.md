# Feature List

This chapter lists Sand's features.

The next chapter describes the code that gets generated for each of these features.

## Don't skip the Inline functions subchapter!

The subchapter about [inline functions](./inline_funcs.md), one of Sand's most powerful features, is tucked away deep in the back due to its apparent complexity.
You may be tempted to skip it, but if you do, you'll be missing out on one of the primary benefits of using Sand.
On the other hand, I wouldn't suggest skipping straight to it either, because the other subchapters help build up concepts that will help you better understand inline functions.
In short, the subchapter was included for a reason, but it was also put in the back for a reason.
