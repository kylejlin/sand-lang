# Syntax differences from Java

This chapter discusses Java constructs you are already familiar with (e.g., ternary operator, `switch` statements, `for` statements, etc.) and how Sand's syntax for those constructs varies from Java's.

This chapters focuses only on constructs already present in Java.

To learn about new constructs introduced by Sand, read the [Sand-specific constructs](../sand_specific/intro.md) chapter
