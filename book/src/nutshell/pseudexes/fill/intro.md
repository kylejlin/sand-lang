# Fill pseudexes

Fill pseudexes are used to create an array or `ArrayList` with the specified values.

There are two types of fill pseudexes:

- [Repeating fill pseudexes](./repeating.md) create an array or list that is populated by repeatedly evaluating the same expression a specified number of times.
- [Sequential fill pseudexes](./sequential.md) create an array or list that is populated with the values resulting from the specified sequence of expressions.
