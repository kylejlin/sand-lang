## TLDR

Sand is a programming language I created in high school.
I created Sand to help me complete my Advanced Placement Computer Science (APCS) assignments more efficiently.
However, I completed my APCS class before I finished Sand.
After I completed my APCS class, I stopped working on Sand, since it had no use to me anymore.

**There is no reason for you, the reader, to learn this programming language.**
I preserve this repository mainly for its sentimental value, and also as a point of comparison for analyzing the evolution of the many compilers I have written.

## Motivation

My AP Computer Science class used a somewhat old version of Java.
This version of Java was too syntactically verbose and ugly for my liking.
However, students had to submit assignments written in this version of Java.

I wanted to write my solutions in another language.
I couldn't use languages like Kotlin, because while these languages
could compile to JVM _bytecode_, they generally could not be compiled to
idiomatic, human-readable Java _source code_.
Furthermore, my instructor required us to follow certain coding conventions,
so I needed to make sure the generated Java code would follow said conventions.
So, I decided to create Sand, to fulfill this niche, unmet need.
